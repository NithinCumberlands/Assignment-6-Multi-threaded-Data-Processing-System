I developed a multi-threaded Data Processing System in Java and Go to simulate parallel task processing.

To run Java: I compile using javac DataProcessingSystem.java and run using java DataProcessingSystem.

To run Go: I execute the program using go run main.go.

I included my complete project in a GitHub repository and added the repo link in my report.
